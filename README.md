# Task Management Application

This is a simple task management application built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them. The application includes features such as a dashboard displaying upcoming, overdue, and completed tasks, priority levels, search and filter functionality, and local storage for data persistence.

## Features

- Dashboard with sections for upcoming tasks, overdue tasks, and completed tasks.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks with title, description, due date, and priority level.
- Three priority levels: High, Medium, Low.
- Search functionality to find tasks quickly.
- Filter tasks based on priority and completion status.
- Local storage to store task data locally using browser storage.

## Setup Instructions

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: [git clone https://github.com/aarvi18/task-management-app.git](https://github.com/aarvi18/task-management-app.git)


2. Navigate to the project directory: cd task-management-app


3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Assumptions

During the development process, the following assumptions were made:
- The application is designed for individual use and does not require user authentication.
- Priority levels are fixed (High, Medium, Low) and cannot be customized.
- The application is built as a single-page application without server-side logic.
